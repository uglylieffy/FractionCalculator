Build a GUI application using C++ code that calculates fractions. 

Pretend that your potential user is a grade school student just learning about using fractions 
- so your application must be robust and friendly.

The user interface allows for the entry of four integer numbers (positive or negative) for the two fractions, 
the selection of an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication or division only),  
and then the press of an "equals" button will display the resulting fraction. 

Error messages can be part of the GUI window or displayed in a message box.
